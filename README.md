# Fun
This is a collection containing my code on whatever I find interesting.

List of problems I have written code for:

1.  visualize_convexHulls.py
    Upon running this code, it will open a screen on which you can place points by clicking it.
    In real time it calculates the convex hulls of all points you have selected and displays onto the screen.

2.  Sierpinski triangle.py
    Upon running this code, it will show a screen on which you have to make triangle by clicking on screen.
    Now click "RUN" button that appears on the right side. 
    Watch it build the fractal!

3. caeser_cipher.py
    Run the code. 
    You will be asked to give an encrypted text (which was encrypted with caeser cipher ofcourse).
    Give the input and click enter.
    It will printout the decrypted text onto the terminal

4.  tic_tac_toe.py
    You can play tic-tac-toe in the terminal!
    There are two modes of playing: The computer's move can be either randomized or perfect play.
    Read the code to know how to change it

5. sudoku.js
    Why js? Just because I want to be fluent in more languages.
    Inputing the board into the code is quite tedious!
    Input your sudoku configuration in code at the appropriate place and run the code.
    Solution will be displayed in the terminal.
